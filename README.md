[How to SLAM the gender gaps of women in Robotics?](https://vimeo.com/showcase/9954564/video/767164735)

How a gender perspective could reduce the gap of women in Robotics. This is a multifaceted approach to a complex problem, exploring the role of stereotypes in engineering fields. Despite a high female representation in different fields/areas, this does not necessarily mean that there is a special focus on gender issues. This is why it is so important to amplify our collective voices and calls to advocate for greater diversity, equity, and inclusion in the fields of robotics. There will be many unresolved challenges and there will be unresolved needs if everything continues in the same way.
