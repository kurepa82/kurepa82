👋 Hi, I'm Belén Torres
Roboticist, Educator & Diversity Advocate in Tech

I'm on a mission to make robotics and technology more inclusive through education, real-world innovation, and community empowerment. I create, teach, and collaborate on projects that aim to bridge gaps and open doors — especially for underrepresented voices in STEM.
